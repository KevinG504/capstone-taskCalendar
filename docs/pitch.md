# Pitch

**A simple task management web application that helps users organize their tasks by priority and due date.

**Problem & User:** Students and professionals need a straightforward way to track their daily tasks without the complexity of enterprise project management tools. This app provides a clean, focused interface for creating, organizing, and completing tasks.

**Core Data Entities:** This app manages a single primary resource: **Tasks**. Each task contains a title, optional description, due date, priority level (low/medium/high), and completion status. Tasks are stored in a JSON file backed database and can be filtered by status and priority.
